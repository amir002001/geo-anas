# geo-anas

This project is a slide-based, interactive map presentation built with **Mapbox for React**.  
It allows navigation between slides, each showing a different geographic view or dataset, with smooth transitions and the ability to zoom, pan, and tilt the map.

The goal is to present spatial data of the genocide in Gaza in a clear and engaging way, combining the flexibility of React with the geographic capabilities of Mapbox.

This project is dedicated to and named after [Anas Al Sharif](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anas_Al-Sharif). May peace be upon him. We have made this with the hope of her daughter seeing a free Palestine and a more just world. If you have some time, please read [Anas's last words](https://xcancel.com/AnasAlSharif0/status/1954670507128914219#m) before he was brutally murdered by the zionist entity occupying Palestine.
